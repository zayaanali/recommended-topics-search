# Development Log

# Week 1
## Weekly Goals
Our goals for this week were to decide on a project idea, create the GitHub repo, and write the project proposal and team contract. 
## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Decide on a project idea: Completed by all team members <br />
Github repo creation: Completed by Zayaan Ali <br />
Project Proposal Written: Completed by all team members <br />
Team Contract Written: Completed by all team members
## Problems Encountered 
We did not encounter any major problems this week. 
## Plans for next week
The plans for next week are to complete the data acquisition and processing. We also plan to start writing pseudocode for the BFS traversal on the graph.
## Optional: Questions for mentor
At this moment, we have no questions or concerns for our mentor.


# Week 2
## Weekly Goals
Our goals for this week were to make corrections to the proposed algorithms and steps from the feedback we received, continue making progress with parsing the data, and begin discussing pseudocode for one of our algorithms (BFS).
## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Editing/Updating the Proposal: Completed by all team members <br />
Data Acquisition: Completed by all team members <br />
First draft of Data Parsing and MakeFile: Completed by Benjamin Chang <br />
Development Log 2: Completed by all team members
## Problems Encountered 
We ran into some issues with project proposal and planning out our project. We ran into an issue that our inputs/outputs were not clearly defined and not all of the algorithms we had planned on using were completely viable. To solve these issues, we talked with our mentor and were able to change the algorithms we used so that we were able to have clearly defined inputs/outputs.
## Plans for next week
The plans for next week are to complete the data processing. We also plan to start writing pseudocode for the BFS traversal on the graph. We also plan on coming up with strategies to process the data, while having as few disjoint sets as possible.
## Optional: Questions for mentor
At this moment, we have no questions or concerns for our mentor.

# Week 3
## Weekly Goals
Our goals for this week were to finalize the CMake build system in our repository, finalize parsing the data, and begin pseudocoding and coding for one of our algorithms (Kosaraju).
## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
Finalize CMake: Completed by Shyam Thyagarajan <br />
Data Parsing (still needs to be finalized): Completed by Benjamin Chang <br />
Pseudocoding and Initial Coding of Kosaraju: Completed by Zayaan Ali <br />
Development Log 3: Completed by all team members
## Problems Encountered 
Ran into some issues with CMake but followed the format for other class assignments to resolve them.
Had difficulties with pseudocoding initially but were able to come to a consensus on the right approach.
## Plans for next week
The plans for next week are to complete the Kosaraju algorithm. We also plan to complete the BFS traversal on the graph fully. We also plan to start working on the Brandes algorithm implementation.
## Optional: Questions for mentor
At this moment, we have no questions or concerns for our mentor.

# Week 4
## Weekly Goals
Our goals for this week were to finalize the BFS algorithm through coding and testing the implementation in a tests.cpp file. We also wanted to finish coding the Kosaraju algorithm and begin working on the Brandes Betweenness Centrality algorithm.
## Specific Tasks Completed (and by who)
BFS Coding and Testing: Completed by Benjamin Chang <br />
Preliminary Work on Brandes: Completed by Shyam Thyagarajan, Arpan Swaroop <br />
Kosaraju Algorithm First Draft of Code: Zayaan Ali <br />
Development Log 4: Completed by all team members
## Problems Encountered 
No major problems were encountered this week.
## Plans for next week
We plan to complete and test Brandes and Kosarajuâ€™s by the beginning of next week and to write the related topics search function using the outputs from those algorithms by the end of the week. This will leave a few days before the deadline to clean up our code and work on our final presentation. 

## Optional: Questions for mentor
At this moment, we have no questions or concerns for our mentor.
