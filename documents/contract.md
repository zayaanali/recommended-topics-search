# Team Contract

## Communication
1. **Team Meetings** 
Our team will meet twice a week on Monday from 7:00 to 8:00 pm and Friday from 3:30 to 4:30 pm. We will be utilizing Discord and taking notes on a shared Google Doc (rotating every week). 
2. **Assistance** 
Teammates will be able to contact each other over Discord chat if they need help. An expected response time would be around a maximum of 12 hours.
3. **Respect** 
We will give everyone a chance to present their ideas, and give everyone a fair opportunity to contribute to the group effort. All team members will be treated with respect and fairness.
## Collaboration

4. **Work Distribution** 
In terms of work distribution, each group member will be tasked with a few functions/classes to work on in the scope of the full final project. This workload will be distributed evenly among the teammates, and if any complications arise with delays on deadlines, the rest of the group will pitch in to help for that particular task; ultimately, the overall work will end up being equal.
5. **Time Commitment** 
Each member commits to working on the project for around 6 hours per week. Time commitment will primarily be judged by the amount of progress made on the project by each group member. If progress is found to be lacking on a specific part of the project, steps will be taken to ensure that it is completed in a timely manner.
6. **Conflict Resolution** 
We will attempt to discuss the cause of the issue and resolve it. If we run into a major problem that we cannot resolve ourselves we will discuss options with our mentor.
